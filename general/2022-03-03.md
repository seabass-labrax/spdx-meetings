## How RKVST Uses SPDX for Software Transparency by Jon Geater, CTO Jitsuin
### Jitsuin, RVST, Digital Twin Consortium
### The Problem
* Cyber physical systems- Data is the new oil. Big Opportunity...but requires trusting data
* Trust can be difficult because everyone is in a supply chain, crossing org boundaries
* Solution approach: Shared asset history w/evidence
* Including BOM
  * Software and hardware combination (depending on industy)
  * SBOM- super crutial first step
*Common understanding takes out human time-consuming steps
* Anyone in the chain should be able to make their own risk assessment
  * Trust is not the same as security
  *Things change/are dynamic...and with software that's frequent
  * So systems need to be able to handle quickly, in real time
### Conclusions
* What's needed is resilient operation of dynamic systems
* Important first step is what's in the box
* ...then vulernablities and what do to about them
* interoperatiblity of standard formats
