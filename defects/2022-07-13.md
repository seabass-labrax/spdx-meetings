## Notes

### Approval of meeting minutes
* https://github.com/spdx/meetings/pull/200 is approved & merged

### Continue discussion on SPDX 3.0 Defects example
* Example: https://gist.github.com/tsteenbe/ea3c9ccf98a0130c5507ecf2e82b9398
*  Rose raised question about externalReferenceCategory missing in 3.0 model to core group over the mailinglist <insert link>

Defects "relationships"
* ADVISORY_FOR,
* SOURCE_OF
* KNOWN_NOT_AFFECTED + other VEX
* PATCHED_BY
* FIX_PROVIDED_BY

1. Reporter / researcher (actor) that discovered a security issue -> found zero day in Python package.
          ????  actor to defect element(s)
2. Vendor/developer (actor) that creates a security vulnerability advisory -> PYSEC creates an advisory.

    ADVISORY_FOR, defect element to software element(s)

3. Coordinator/vendor (actor) that distributing the security vulnerability advisory -> GitHub distributes it via their vulnerabilities API.

    ADVISORY_FOR, defect element to software element(s)

4. Vendor/developer (actor) that fixes the security issue -> fixes zero day in Python package
5. Vendor/developer/user (actor) receives security advisory and makes a risk decision  -> updated to a newer version of Python packages that includes fix for zero day

Option 1:
element => artifact => defect => property: defectPurpose: [ defectPurpose ]
                                                  => property: identifiedBy (use for scenario 1. to point to reporter / researcher)
                                                  => property: createdBy (use for scenario 3. vendor/developer)
                                                  => property: orginator (use for scenario 2. vendor/developer)

Option 2:
For software:
element [property: profile: defects] => artifact => advisory [property: advisoryPurpose]

For hardware:
element [property: profile: defects] => artifact => advisory [property: advisoryPurpose]

advisoryPurpose => own enum with values:
    - vulnerability: security info
    - bug: undesired behavior of software
    - privacy: exposing PII data
    - support: e.g. end-of-life
    - safety: e.g. HBOM physical safety


* discussion about if defect should hang off of artifact or if Option 1 is symantically confusing
* discussion about if defect could be a replacement for "bug" in the enum of Option 2
