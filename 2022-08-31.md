## Notes

# Meeting Minutes
* Approval of meeting minutes - approved and merged

# SPDX 2.3 released
* Defect WG work on 2.3 is now officially part of the SPDX spec see https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/external-repository-identifiers/ and https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/how-to-use/

# SPDX 3.0 Defects example

* We want the capability to capture the status of security issues in the packages in a software's SBOM - e.g., "we know this CVE will be found but it's not an issue'.
* This would be seperated from linking to dynamic security info.
* This would be only used on creation of package/product SBOM. Cuts down need for downstream to investigate security issues.
* Goal: convey when the vulnerability does not affect the package in this specific software
* Thomas: What about "won't fix "or "can't fix"?
* Jeff: Useful in open source community but creates a lot of noise in vendor community. Adoption by vendors is likely low
* Bob: Useful for FOSS community to denote branch will not get fixes
* In summary: standard should convey many types of status (see https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/csd02/csaf-v2.0-csd02.html#45-profile-5-vex for status types) and shouldn't be limited to only those terminal states of a vulnerability in a release of software SBOM. Primary use would be "not affected" and "fixed" but there may be other statuses used.

Next Meeting: dig into symantically how we might do this with the SPDX 3.0 model
* e.g. using relationships
* e.g. using a class and associated properties specific to a security profile
* e.g. creating an Element extension

Note: Skipping September 7 meeting  due to several regular members not being able to attend
